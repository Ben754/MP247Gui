# MP247Gui
A Simple User Interface for Mario Party 24/7

## What is this?

On TwitchTV, there's a Channel made by the same person who made TwitchPlaysPokemon called [MarioParty24/7](http://twitch.tv/marioparty247). This is a simple user interface for that stream, eliminating the need to use /w every time you want to do something.

## Where can I download it?
