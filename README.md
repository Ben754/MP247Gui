## What is this?

On TwitchTV, there's a Channel made by the same person who made TwitchPlaysPokemon called [MarioParty24/7](http://twitch.tv/marioparty247). This is a simple user interface for that stream, eliminating the need to use /w every time you want to do something.

## Where can I download it?

## Is there anything I need to run it?

You need Java 8. Get that [Here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html). After that's installed, just double click the jar file.
